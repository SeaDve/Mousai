Discover songs you are aching to know with an easy-to-use interface.

Mousai is a simple application that can recognize songs similar to Shazam. Just
click the listen button, and then wait a few seconds. It will magically return
the title and artist of that song!

Note: This uses the API of audd.io, so it is necessary to log in to their site to get more trials.

Why you will love Mousai?
* 🎵 Recognize songs within seconds or save for later when offline
* 🎙️ Use microphone or desktop audio
* 🎸 Build a repertoire of recognized songs
* 🎼 Quickly preview the song within the interface
* 🌐 Browse and listen the song from different providers
* 📱 Easy-to-use user interface

## 🌈 AudD

AudD is a music recognition API that makes Mousai possible. For more information,
you can check their [Privacy Policy](https://audd.io/privacy/) and [Terms of Service](https://audd.io/terms/).


## 🏗️ Building from source

### GNOME Builder
GNOME Builder is the environment used for developing this application. It can use Flatpak manifests to create a consistent building and running environment cross-distro. Thus, it is highly recommended you use it.

1. Download [GNOME Builder](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Builder).
2. In Builder, click the "Clone Repository" button at the bottom, using `https://github.com/SeaDve/Mousai.git` as the URL.
3. Click the build button at the top once the project is loaded.

### Meson
```
git clone https://github.com/SeaDve/Mousai.git
cd Mousai
meson _build --prefix=/usr/local
ninja -C _build install
```
